NEW IN VERSION 1.0

- Fix: don't complain if the links tdla, tdll etc already exist when installing.

- Add -q option to suppress "no database" warning.

- Fix: initialise 'parent' properly when creating nodes

- Allow dates to be specified for 'add' and 'done'.  'list' ignores entries
  added 'in the future', except with -a.  Extend 'edit' command to allow start
  date/time to be modified.

- Improve installation process (patch from Juergen Daubert)

- Added 'undo' command (for reversing accidental 'done' commands).

- If 'list' command is given index argument(s), use the priority of each such
  entry as the default (instead of 'normal') when deciding whether to display
  it and its children, unless a specific priority was given on the command
  line.

- Added 'which' command, to display the path to the database that is being
  used.

NEW IN VERSION 0.7

- New before and after commands with identical operation to above and below.

- List command now shows only items of at least normal priority by default, and
  can take a priority argument.

- New import and export commands

- The remove, done and priority commands can take indices of the form 1... to
  mean entry 1 and everything underneath it.

- Priorities can be specified by just their initial letter (or any bigger
  substring)

- Add tdlg to do log as a single command name.
