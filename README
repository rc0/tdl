INTRODUCTION
tdl is a lightweight program for managing a 'to-do' list of pending jobs that
you have.
    
It supports the following features :
- 1 database per directory, or per tree of directories (tdl searches up through
  parent directories to find the database, so you can have one per project, for
  example.)
- add new entries, mark them done, edit the text of entries
- add a new entry and immediately mark it done (e.g. to log tasks you did which
  you tackled immediately you got them.)
- organise the entries in a tree structure (sub-tasks of other tasks etc)
- move the tasks around and re-organise the hierarchy.
- list the tasks in the database (default listing excludes 'done' tasks, but
  these can be shown too if desired).  The listing is in colour by default, with
  monochrome output as an option.
- allows entries to be prioritised (priorities shown in different colours on
  listing)
- track date added and date completed for each task
- generate report of tasks completed in a given earlier time period (useful if
  you have to produce a weekly summary of your work done, for example)
- written in C
- runs on a Linux console or in a terminal window.  It currently generates a
  coloured listing, so a colour xterm or rxvt is preferred.

The functionality and interface are heavily inspired by the program devtodo.
