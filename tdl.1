.SH DESCRIPTION
A small program for managing a to-do list.
.PP
All forms may take
.I -q
as the first command line argument.  Currently, this suppresses the warning
message if no existing database can be found.  The intended use is for using
.B tdll
when changing into a directory, to list outstanding work in that directory.

.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.B tdl above
.I index_to_insert_above
.I index_to_move ...
.br
.B tdl before
.I index_to_insert_above
.I index_to_move ...
.PP
This command moves one or more entries to a new location in the tree.  The
first index specifies the entry which will end up immediately below the moved
entries after the operation.  As a special case, you can specify the final
component of the first argument as zero.  In this case, the moved entries
appear as the last children of the parent node afterwards.

.I [priority]
.I text_for_node
.br
.B tdla
.I [@datespec]
.I [parent_index]
.I [priority]
.I text_for_node
.PP
The
.B add
command is used to add a new entry to the database.
.PP
.B datespec
is the time at which the entry will be visible when the database is printed
with the
.B list
command.  It defaults to now.  The format for datespec is described in the
.B "DATE SPECIFICATION"
section later in this page.
.PP
.B parent_index
is the index of the parent node (e.g. 1 or 2.4).  This defaults to the root
node if missing, i.e. a new top-level entry is created.
.PP
.B priority is one of
.IR urgent ,
.IR high ,
.IR normal ,
.IR low " or"
.IR verylow .
Normal is the default if this argument is not specified.  Priorities may be
abbreviated (even to just the first letter.)
.PP
.B text_for_node
is the text describing the task for this entry.  If this is more than a single
word, you will need to quote it to make the shell keep it as a single argument
to tdl.  The text may span multiple lines (i.e. if you hit return whilst the
quotation marks are still open in the shell.)
.PP
If no database exists, the
.B add
command will create it automatically (in the current directory, unless the
.B TDL_DATABASE
environment is set, in which case this specifies the path to use).

.B tdl below
.I index_to_insert_below
.I index_to_move ...
.br
.B tdl after
.I index_to_insert_below
.I index_to_move ...
.PP
This command moves one or more entries to a new location in the tree.  The
first index specifies the entry which will end up immediately above the moved
entries after the operation.  As a special case, you can specify the final
component of the first argument as zero.  In this case, the moved entries
appear as the first children of the parent node afterwards.

.PP
.B tdl done
.I @datespec
.I index_of_done_entry ...
.PP
.B tdld
.I @datespec
.I index_of_done_entry ...
.PP
The
.B done
command is used to mark one or more tasks as completed.  The effects are as follows:
.IP o
The entries no longer appear on the default listing (tdl list / tdll)
.IP o
The entries are eligible to appear on the report list (tdl report)
.IP o
The entries are eligible for removal by the purge command (tdl purge.)
.PP
If the string "..." is appended to an index, it means that entry and all its
descendents.  This provides a quick way to mark a whole sub-tree of tasks as
being completed.
.PP
.B datespec
is the time at which the entry/entries should be marked as having been
completed.  The default is to mark them completed at the current time.  The
competion time of an entry affects whether it is shown by the
.B report
command for a particular range of reported times.
.PP
The format for datespec is described in the
.B "DATE SPECIFICATION"
section later in this page.

.PP
.B tdl export
.I filename
.I index_to_export ...
.PP
This command is used to create a new TDL database (whose name is given by the
.I filename
argument).  The initial contents of the new database are the entries specified
by the list of indices following the filename, in that order.  Each index
becomes a top-level entry of the new database.  The operation is read-only on
the original database.

.PP
.B tdl import
.I filename
.PP
This command is used to merge entries from the TDL database
.I filename
into the default TDL database (i.e. the one that most of the other commands
would be accessing).
.PP
You might use this command if you had a number of separate TDL databases, and
wanted to merge their entries to form one combo database.
.P

--ooOOoo--
.PP
.B tdl into
.I new_parent_index
.I indices_to_move ...
.PP
This command moves one or more entries under a new parent entry.  It is
equivalent to the
.B above
command when the
.B new_parent_index
argument has ".0" appended to it.
.P

.PP
.B tdl list
.I [-v]
.I [-a]

.br
.B tdll
.I [-v]
.I [-a]
.I [-m]
.I [<min-priority>]
.I [<parent_index> ...]
.PP
The
.B list
command is used to display the entries in the database.  By default, only
entries that have not been marked
.B done
and which don't have start times deferred into the future are shown.  If you
want to display all entries, include the
.B -a
option (which means 'all').  If you want to display the dates and times when
the entries were added and/or done, include the 
.B -v
option (which means 'verbose').
.PP
By default, only entries having normal, high or urgent priority are shown.  To
change the minimum priority shown, specify the
.B min-priority
argument.  For example, 'tdll h' will only show entries with priority high or
urgent.
.PP
By default, the whole database is scanned.  If you only want to show part(s) of
the database, additional arguments can be given.  These are the indices of the
top node of each part of the database you want to show.  So if your database
contains entries with indices 1, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1, 3 and 4, the command
.PP
tdl list -a 2
.PP
will show all entries 2, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.2.1, whether or not they are completed.
.PP
By default, the listing is produced with colour highlighting.  The
.B -m
option can be used to produce a monochrome listing instead.  Alternatively, the
.B TDL_LIST_MONOCHROME
enviroment variable can be set (to any value) to achieve the same effect.
.PP
The colours are assigned as follows:

.B tdl log
.br
.B tdlg
.PP
This command is used to add a new entry and mark it done immediately.  It is
most useful in conjunction with the
.B report
command, to record unexpected extra tasks you had to do.
.PP
The arguments for the
.B log
command are the same as those for the
.B add
command.
.P

.PP
.B tdl pri
.I new_priority
.I index_to_change ...
.PP
This command changes the priority of one or more entries.  The indices are in
the same format as those in the output of the
.B list
command.  The
.B new_priority
argument takes the same possible values as for the
.B add
command.
.P

--ooOOoo--
.PP
.B tdl purge
.I since_epoch
.I [entry_index...]
.PP
This command is used to remove old done entries from the database.  It is much more convenient than repeated
.B remove
commands.
.PP
The
.B since_epoch
argument specifies a time.  The format for this argument is described in the
.B "DATE SPECIFICATION"
section later. Entries that were marked done (using the
.B done
command) before that epoch will be purged.
.PP
Zero or more
.B entry_indices
may be given.  These restrict the purging to just those entries and their
descendents.  The default is to purge the entire database.
.P
.ce 1
--ooOOoo--
.PP
.B tdl remove
.I index_to_remove ...
.PP
Completely remove one or more entries from the database.  The indices are the
same format as those shown in the output of the
.B done
command.
.PP
If the string "..." is appended to an index, it means that entry and all its
descendents.  This provides a quick way to remove a whole sub-tree of tasks.
.P
.ce 1
--ooOOoo--
.PP
.B tdl report
.I start_time
.I [end_time]
.PP
The
.B report
command produces a report (in bulleted list format) of tasks completed in a
certain time period.  This is useful if (for example) you have to write a
weekly summary of the work you've done.
.PP
The default for the end of the time period is the current time, if the
.B end_time
argument is not present.  The start of the period to report on must always be
specified.  The format for the time arguments is described in the
.B "DATE SPECIFICATION"
section later.
Examples :
.PP
tdl report 1w
.PP
will list all tasks completed in the previous week, whereas
.PP
tdl report 2w 1w
.PP
will list all tasks completed between 2 and 1 weeks ago.
.P
.ce 1
--ooOOoo--
.PP
.B tdl undo
.I index_of_entry_to_undo ...
.PP
This command cancels the effect of the
.B done
command for one or more entries, e.g. after they have been mistakenly marked as
done.
.PP
If the string "..." is appended to an index, it means that entry and all its
descendents.  This provides a quick way to re-open a whole sub-tree of tasks.

.SH DATE SPECIFICATIONS
.PP
The commands
.BR add ,
.BR done ,
.BR purge ,
.BR report ,
take arguments defining dates (with add and done it is optional).  Dates may be specified in several formats, shown by the following examples:
.PP
.TS
tab(&);
l l.
-1h & exactly 1 hour ago
-2d & exactly 2 days ago
+1w & exactly 1 week in the future
+1m & exactly 1 month (30 days) in the future
+2y & exactly 2 years in the future
-1d-0815 & 08:15am yesterday
+1d-08 & 8am tomorrow
+1w-08 & 8am on the same day as today next week
+6h-08 & 8am on the day containing the time 6 hours ahead of now
20011020 & absolute : 12 noon on 20th October 2001
011020 & absolute : 12 noon on 20th October 2001 (current century)
1020 & absolute : 12 noon on 20th October 2001 (current century and year)
20 & absolute : 12 noon on 20th October 2001 (current century, year and month)
20011020-081500 & absolute : 08:15am on 20th October 2001
20011020-0815 & absolute : 08:15am on 20th October 2001 (seconds=0)
20011020-08 & absolute : 08:00am on 20th October 2001 (minutes=seconds=0)
011020-08 & absolute : 08:00am on 20th October 2001 (minutes=seconds=0, current century)
etc & (see below)
-sun & 12 noon on the previous Sunday
+sat & 12 noon on the following Saturday
+sat-08 & 8am on the following Saturday
-tue-0815 & 08:15am on the previous Tuesday
etc & (see below)
.TE
.PP
In the 'all-numeric' format, the rule is that dates can have fields omitted
from the start (assumed to be the current value), and times can have fields
omitted from the end (assumed to be zero, except if the hours figure is missing
it is assumed to be 12, since most work is done in the day.)
.PP
In the 'weekday and time' format, the time rule is the same: missing minutes
and seconds are taken as zero and missing hours as 12.  If the weekday is the
same as today, the offset is always 7 days in the required direction.  If the
weekday is not the same as today, the offset will always be less than 7 days in
the required direction.
.PP
In the 'relative' format, when a time is included as well, the procedure is as
follows.  First the time is determined which is the given number of hours, days
etc away from the current time.  Then the specified time on that day is used.
The main use for this is to specify times like '8am yesterday'.  Obviously some
of the more uses of this mode are rather far-fetched.
.PP
For the weekday and relative formats, the sign is actually optional.  The
default sign (implying past (-) or future (+)) will then be assumed depending on
the command as shown below:

.PP
.TS
tab(&);
l l l.
Command & Default & Reason
_
add & + & Add entries with deferred start times
done & - & Entries have been completed at some time in the past
report & - & Reporting on earlier completed tasks not future ones
purge & - & Tasks won't be completed in the future, so no need to purge future ones

.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
.PP
I got the idea from a program called devtodo.  I liked what that program did
and the command line approach to using it, but I ran into lots of compilation
problems with it on older C++ installations.  The path of least resistance
turned out to be to hack up a C program to do a similar job.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
TDL_DATABASE
If this variable is set, it defines the name of the file to use for holding the
database of tasks.  If the variable is not set, the search approach described
in the FILES section is used.
.TP
TDL_LIST_MONOCHROME
If this variable is set, the output from the
.B list
command is produced in monochrome instead of colour (the default).
.SH FILES
.TP
 ./.tdldb, ../.tdldb, ../../.tdldb, ...
If the TDL_DATABASE environment variable is not present, the file .tdldb in the
current directory is used, if that is present.  If not, the same file in the
parent directory is used, and so on, until the root directory of the filesystem
is reached.  If the database is still not found, a new one will be created in
the current directory (except for options that don't modify the database, such
as list, help and version.)
